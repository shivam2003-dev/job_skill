# Merge Intervals Pattern

## Pattern Overview

The **Merge Intervals** pattern is all about working with time ranges that might overlap. Each time range, or interval, is defined by a start and an end point—for example, [10, 20] means the range starts at 10 and ends at 20. The pattern works by identifying overlapping intervals and merging them into one. If there is no overlap, the interval is kept as it is.

## When to Use This Pattern

Your problem matches this pattern if **both** of these conditions are fulfilled:

### ✅ Use Merge Intervals When:

1. **Array of intervals**: The input data is an array of intervals.

2. **Overlapping intervals**: The problem requires dealing with overlapping intervals, either to find their union, their intersection, or the gaps between them.

### ❌ Don't Use Merge Intervals When:

1. **Single points in time**: Working with discrete timestamps rather than ranges
2. **No overlap possibility**: Intervals are guaranteed to be non-overlapping
3. **Different data structures**: Input is not interval-based (trees, graphs, etc.)
4. **Simple sorting needed**: Problem only requires ordering without merging

## Core Concepts

### Interval Representation
- **Start and End Points**: Each interval has a beginning and ending value
- **Inclusive vs Exclusive**: Define whether endpoints are included in the range
- **Overlap Detection**: Two intervals overlap if one starts before the other ends

### Overlap Conditions
- **Complete Overlap**: One interval entirely contains another
- **Partial Overlap**: Intervals share some common range
- **Adjacent Intervals**: End of one meets start of another (may or may not merge)
- **No Overlap**: Intervals are completely separate

### Basic Algorithm Steps
1. **Sort intervals** by start time (usually)
2. **Iterate through sorted intervals**
3. **Check for overlap** with previous interval
4. **Merge or keep separate** based on overlap condition
5. **Update result** with merged or individual intervals

## Implementation Templates

### Basic Merge Intervals
```python
def merge_intervals(intervals):
    if not intervals:
        return []
    
    # Sort by start time
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    
    merged = [intervals[0]]
    
    for current in intervals[1:]:
        last = merged[-1]
        
        # Check for overlap
        if current[0] <= last[1]:
            # Merge intervals
            merged[-1] = [last[0], max(last[1], current[1])]
        else:
            # No overlap, add current interval
            merged.append(current)
    
    return merged
```

### Find Interval Intersections
```python
def interval_intersection(list1, list2):
    result = []
    i = j = 0
    
    while i < len(list1) and j < len(list2):
        # Find intersection
        start = max(list1[i][0], list2[j][0])
        end = min(list1[i][1], list2[j][1])
        
        if start <= end:
            result.append([start, end])
        
        # Move pointer of interval that ends first
        if list1[i][1] < list2[j][1]:
            i += 1
        else:
            j += 1
    
    return result
```

**Solution Approach**: 
- Collect all busy intervals from user's calendar
- Merge overlapping or adjacent time slots
- Display consolidated "busy" blocks
- Preserve privacy while showing availability

**Implementation Strategy**:
```python
def get_busy_schedule(meetings):
    # meetings = [(start_time, end_time, is_private), ...]
    busy_intervals = [(start, end) for start, end, _ in meetings]
    return merge_intervals(busy_intervals)
```

**Business Impact**: Improved privacy, cleaner calendar views, easier scheduling coordination, and better user experience.

### 2. **Meeting Scheduling Systems**

**Schedule a New Meeting**: Add a new meeting to the tentative meeting schedule of a user in such a way that no two meetings overlap each other.

**Business Problem**: Prevent double-booking while efficiently finding available time slots for new meetings. Manual conflict checking is error-prone and time-consuming.

**Solution Approach**:
- Maintain sorted list of existing meetings
- For new meeting request, check for conflicts
- Find available slots that accommodate meeting duration
- Suggest alternative times if conflicts exist

**Real-World Example**: Microsoft Outlook's scheduling assistant uses interval merging to show combined availability of multiple attendees and suggest optimal meeting times.

**Business Impact**: Eliminates scheduling conflicts, reduces administrative overhead, improves productivity, and enhances user satisfaction.

## When NOT to Use Merge Intervals

1. **Point-based problems**: Single timestamps rather than ranges
2. **Already sorted and merged**: Input is guaranteed non-overlapping
3. **Complex multi-dimensional**: Simple interval logic doesn't apply
4. **Tree/Graph structures**: Different algorithmic approaches needed
5. **String/Array manipulation**: Interval concept doesn't map well

## Tips for Success

1. **Always sort first**: Most interval problems require sorted input
2. **Define overlap clearly**: Establish precise overlap conditions early
3. **Handle edge cases**: Empty arrays, single intervals, no overlaps
4. **Use appropriate data structures**: Arrays for simple cases, trees for complex queries
5. **Test boundary conditions**: Adjacent intervals, identical intervals
6. **Consider time zones**: Real-world applications often involve multiple time zones
7. **Plan for updates**: Static vs dynamic interval sets require different approaches

## Conclusion

The Merge Intervals pattern is essential for:
- Calendar and scheduling applications
- Resource allocation and management
- Time-based data processing
- Conflict detection and resolution
- Optimization problems with temporal constraints
